## Chapter 2 Memory Hierarchy Design

### 2.1 Introduction

- The principle of locality
:  most programs do not access all code or data uniformly. Locality occurs in time (temporal locality) and in space (spatial locality)

- The goal is to provide a memory system with cost per byte almost as low as the cheapest level of memory and speed almost as fast as the fastest level.

- inclusion property: In most cases (but not all), the data contained in a lower level are a superset of the next higher level.
