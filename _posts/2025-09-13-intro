Befor I introduce my back ground and abilities, I would like to share my philosophy about thinking and problem-solving.

After several years of high tense of mathematics training, I have been used to analyze a problem fastly and thoroghly.

When I was given a problem, I can reflexively start a seris of procedure to handle it. 

First of all, I check what I have, means, the hyposis or conditions I have, understanding the current situation. 

And then think what tools do I have that are related to this problem. and also try to break down original problem into several little problem.

This especialy help me a lot in the current AI enviroment, I have the ability to break down complex problem and feed simple but detailed statement with some initial thought or hint of tools together to LLM to help me solve problems.

With this problem-solving mind and a little bit C++ knowedge, I joined Aargo as a C++ developer for my first full time job. 

Despite the fact that I have little knowedge about software development and engineering, I still learned every thing fastly and mastered it.

I am always trying to do my best to make my program have better behavior and make client-side have better experience using the API I provide. I discuss with traders and tech members to assure we are alined. I understand the busness need. Turn them into technical problem. 

And after this 1 and half year journey, I was fasinated by software development, especialy the low-level part. I love every techniques to make program run faster and faster. I try to use eBPF or perf to observe my program and analyze how to reduce latency. and I hope I can join a team that are focusing on it in the future, this is why I applied this position.
